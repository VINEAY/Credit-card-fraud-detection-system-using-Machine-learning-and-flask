🔐 Credit Card Fraud Detection using ML and Flask
🧠 Problem:
Fraudulent transactions continue to plague the banking and fintech industries, causing billions in annual losses. Most small- to mid-sized institutions lack a scalable, real-time fraud detection system that integrates seamlessly with their existing workflows.

💡 Solution:
This project provides a lightweight yet powerful fraud detection system using XGBoost, trained on a Kaggle dataset of anonymized credit card transactions. I built a Flask-based web interface that allows real-time predictions by uploading CSVs or single-row inputs. It also includes outlier filtering, correlation heatmaps, and class imbalance handling with SMOTE.

🔧 Tech Stack:

Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost

Flask: REST-based prediction endpoint and UI

Power BI: Visual dashboards for fraud distribution

Jupyter Notebook: EDA, model training and metrics

Heroku (optional): Cloud-based deployment

📊 Impact:
Helped demystify end-to-end ML deployment for students and early-stage developers. Gained forks from devs seeking to embed fraud detection into their apps. Showcases real-world classification, ROC-AUC evaluation, and model interpretability for non-technical stakeholders.
